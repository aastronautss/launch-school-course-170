## The Request-Response Cycle

**1.** For a request, the method and the path are the required components. Optional components include headers and a body. Parameters are technically a part of the path, but are optional.

**2.** An HTTP resposne requires status codes. Headers and a body are optional.

**3.** GET requests are typically done when the client wants to retrieve data, and POST requests are done when the client wants to submit data to the server.

**4.** The host component of a URL could be present in an HTTP response, but is not required.
